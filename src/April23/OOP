1.Payment System(Interface)

Requirements:
* Create an Interface Payable:
    void pay(double amount):

* Implement two Classes:
    *CreditCardPayment
    *CashPayment
* Each should print a custom message in pay() indicating how the payment is processed.

BONUS:
* While a method that takes a Payable[] and changes each one a random amount between $1-100.
* Demonstrate how the same method can call pay() on all types using polymorphism.
* Add refund(double amount) method to the interface.Think about how CreditCardPayment and CashPayment would behave differently.
